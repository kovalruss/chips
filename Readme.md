# ðŸ‘¾ Chips

Chips is a tool that inserts "chips" to your code, detecting unused fragments. Then shows unused functions in a pretty table. Might be used for developing, refactoring and manual testing purposes

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Chips.

```bash
pip install python-chips
```

## Usage

1) Add chips to your project (-a --add)

```bash
python -m chips --add
```
2) Use your code (trigger functions in a way: make api requests, click website, etc..)

3) See the auto generated results at .chipping_results/results.py in a pretty table

4) Remove chips (-r --remove)
```bash
python -m chips --remove
```

## Chipping path
Basically Chips are performing on a root path of your project. You can specify a folder path, where you want Chips to perform. Use -p --path arg.
```bash
python -m chips -a -p <DESIRED PATH>
```

## Bad performance
If you struggle from a bad performance after chipping, use --auto off to turn off auto generated results
```bash
python -m chips -a --auto off
```

Then you'll need to generate results manually (-rs --results)
```bash
python -m chips --results
```
